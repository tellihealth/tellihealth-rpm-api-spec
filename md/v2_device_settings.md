### Device behavior description

The deviceâ€™s settings will be updated.

Gen2 devices may receive settings for the reminder alerts. Since the device may be off at the time the settings are sent, this message is delivered asynchronously. The device responds during its next successful connection session. When the platform receives an acknowledgement (ACK) from the device, the platform publishes an ACK to the registered endpoint. When the settings endpoint is called between ACK messages, the settings value updates to the newly requested value.

An alert setting will not activate for a time set in the past, but will remain inactive until it's set time is reached during the next alert timeframe. For example, if the start time is 08:00 and it is now 08:05, the alert message will be delayed until 08:00 on the following day.
