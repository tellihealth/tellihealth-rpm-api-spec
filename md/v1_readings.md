### Device behavior description

A Gen1 device delivered a new reading to the Telli Health platform.  
Reading value messages are delivered when:

1. The user activates the device,  
2. The user takes a measurement,  
3. The device can read the current time, and  
4. The device acknowledges that the data was sent to the platform.

Reading transmission types include Blood Pressure, Blood Glucose, Weight Scale, SpO2 Pulse Oximetry, Peak Flow, Thermometer, Sleeping Mat Activity, and Sleeping Mat Duration.

#### Sleep and Resting Heart Rate Monitor

Both the Sleeping Mat Activity and Sleeping Mat Duration readings provide data for Telli Health's sleep mat and resting heart monitor service.   

Sleeping Mat Activity provides data collected every four hours during a fixed 12-hour interval between 8 p.m. (20:00) and 8 a.m. (08:00). Sleep mat averages are taken while the mat is in use. Sampling is paused if a user gets out of bed without the mat being active.  

Sleeping Mat Duration provides data collected at the end of the sleep interval.
